For example, the majority of faces in CelebA (our training set) are those of light-skinned females. As a result, a classifier trained on CelebA will be better suited at recognizing and classifying faces with features similar to these, and will thus be biased.\n\nHow could we overcome this? A naive solution -- and one that is being adopted by many companies and organizations -- would be to annotate different subclasses (i.e., light-skinned females, males with hats, etc.) within the training data, and then manually even out the data with respect to these groups.\n\nBut this approach has two major disadvantages. First, it requires annotating massive amounts of data, which is not scalable. Second, it requires that we know what potential biases (e.g., race, gender, pose, occlusion, hats, glasses, etc.) to look for in the data. As a result, manual annotation may not capture all the different features that are imbalanced within the training data.\n\nInstead, let's actually **learn** these features in an unbiased, unsupervised manner, without the need for any annotation, and then train a classifier fairly with respect to these features.

To think about why this may be, consider the dataset the model was trained on, CelebA. If certain features, such as dark skin or hats, are *rare* in CelebA, the model may end up biased against these as a result of training with a biased dataset. That is to say, its classification accuracy will be worse on faces that have under-represented features, such as dark-skinned faces or faces with hats, relevative to faces with features well-represented in the training data! This is a problem.\n\nOur goal is to train a *debiased* version of this classifier -- one that accounts for potential disparities in feature representation within the training data. Specifically, to build a debiased facial classifier, we'll train a model that **learns a representation of the underlying latent space** to the face training data. The model then uses this information to mitigate unwanted biases by sampling faces with rare features, like dark skin or hats, *more frequently* during training. The key design requirement for our model is that it can learn an *encoding* of the latent features in the face data in an entirely *unsupervised* way. To achieve this, we'll turn to variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\n![The concept of a VAE](https://i.ibb.co/3s4S6Gc/vae.jpg)\n\nAs shown in the schematic above and in Lecture 4, VAEs rely on an encoder-decoder structure to learn a latent representation of the input data. In the context of computer vision, the encoder network takes in input images, encodes them into a series of variables defined by a mean and standard deviation, and then draws from the distributions defined by these parameters to generate a set of sampled latent variables. The decoder network then \"decodes\" these variables to generate a reconstruction of the original image, which is used during training to help the model identify which latent variables are important to learn.\n\nLet's formalize two key aspects of the VAE model and define relevant functions for each.\n","metadata":{"id":"nLemS7dqECsI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Understanding VAEs: loss function\n\nIn practice, how can we train a VAE?

We want to increase the relative frequency of rare data by increased sampling of under-represented regions of the latent space. We can approximate ${Q}(z|X)$ using the frequency distributions of each of the learned latent variables, and then define the probability distribution of selecting a given datapoint $x$ based on this approximation.
